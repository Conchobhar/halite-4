    -ship yards prioritize spawn location
    - call_home and attack targets
        - turn 399, convert if it gains any halite

    -live
        - 3rd yard
            - cluster on density map
        - need to deposit more frequently
            - change frust limit to 4, maintain 3rd yard?
                -proritize spawn yard by
            - gbl overharesting to 2*sigma?


    - ATTACK if harvesting not worth it
        - attack yards insde r=5 of yards

    -ZONES
        -send to zones rather than spots
        -once at zone, pick best spot
        -optimize spot on each turn - if ship moves to avoid collision, drop sopt
        -leastHaliteShips chase opponents

    cal global self ship density and enemy ship density
    normalize threat - median ship halite is zero point
    each spot weighted by ((myships + 1)/(myships + 1 + eships)
        if only my ships, weight is 1
        if no ships weight is one
        only enemy, weight is zero

    - Changes to validate in isolation
    Go home logic
                > if ship.halite > (target_cell.halite_local_mean + target_cell.halite_local_std * ???):

    -each ship should have its own threat modifier for cells
        -ve if ship.halite < avg. enemy
        +ve if ship.halite > avg. enemy

    -advanced pathing to avoid threat dense areas

    -assault role, enabled when not worth mining
