    - best_ship_for_convert function of halite density
    - call_home and attack targets
        - turn 399, convert if it gains any halite

    -live
        - reevalute step needs to consider enemy density
        -fix evasion
        - match nships of any player rather than one with most hlite
            -maintain ships (my halite - their halite) / costOfShip
        - need to deposit more frequently
            - change frust limit to 4
            - gbl overharesting to 2*sigma?


        - attack if harvesting not worth it
            - attack yards insde r=5 of yards
        - choose local harvest spot better
        - choose global harvbets spot better
    cal global self ship density and enemy ship density
    normalize threat - median ship halite is zero point
    each spot weighted by ((myships + 1)/(myships + 1 + eships)
        if only my ships, weight is 1
        if no ships weight is one
        only enemy, weight is zero

        -choose requirements better for overharvesting
        -


        ships spread to sparsely - should weight spots by n enemy ship density

    -ZONES
        -send to zones rather than spots
        -once at zone, pick best spot
        -optimize spot on each turn - if ship moves to avoid collision, drop sopt
        -leastHaliteShips chase opponents
    -issues


    - Changes to validate in isolation
    Go home logic
                < if ship.halite > (target_cell.halite_local_mean * 4):
                > if ship.halite > (target_cell.halite_local_mean + target_cell.halite_local_std * ???):
                or
                > if ship.halite > (ship.halite / target_cell.halite_local_sum > 1 ???)

    -improve harvest logic
        if spot.halite < threshold, go to nearby spot Why is ship returning home so early?
        exclude spots below a threshold - more valuable to protect spots than harvest
        calculate est. harvest time on cell as time taken to reduce spot to e.g. 50

    -Maintain extra yards
        - if halite > 2k


    -each ship should have its own threat modifier for cells
        -ve if ship.halite < avg. enemy
        +ve if ship.halite > avg. enemy

    -advanced pathing to avoid threat dense areas

    -assault role, enabled when not worth mining
